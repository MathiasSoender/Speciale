PTV2: Child pointer should be to longest leaf below (or at least a leaf which has pattern length bigger than P)
 - Issue: If P is matched with a suffix which is smaller than P, step 2.2.2 of section 4.2, would fail. 
 -         (There can be matches, but as we are stuck on child leaf which do not match, we return incorrectly)
 - Fix is to select leaf greedily: Take leaf with lowest suffix index. (Largest suffix)

PTv3 idea:
Compress S
Insert S_i by: Find "i" position in S. (Can be done by a map)
 - If "i" occurs in a phrase, open up the phrase and do work.
